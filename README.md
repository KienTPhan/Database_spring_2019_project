# Database_spring_2019_project
In this project, we use ASP.Net for the server side and HTML,CSS, D3 js library on the client side. In the visualization, we display terrorism activity throught the world in the years 1970 to 2017. Users will be allowed to select a range of years and select which specific country they are interested in learning. In this image below, it displays the terrorist activity between 2006 and 2012 and China as the selected country. The line graph displays the number of people killed in each year. While on the map it displays the exact location where the attack occured and the size of the circle displays how many people were killed in that event.
